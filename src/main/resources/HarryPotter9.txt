“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and
wrenched it open.

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced,
wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair
windswept. He straightened up, looked around the
room, making sure of who was there, then cried
aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s
father!”

Hermione shrieked.

“Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?”

“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All
around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief:
Hermione and Fleur both squealed,

“Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as
if he had never heard of such a thing before.

“Yes — yes — a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed
dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the
table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of
Grimmauld Place might never have happened.

“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry.

“M-me?” stammered Harry

“You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one
better — ”

“I — yeah — blimey — ”

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now
Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was
persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.

“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin,
beaming around at them all: He looked years younger
than Harry had ever seen him. “Thank you, thank
you, Bill.”

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and
raised them high in a toast.

“To Teddy Remus Lupin,” said Lupin, “a great wizard
in the making!”

“ ’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired.

“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like
me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was
born, but I swear it’s turned ginger in the hour since.
Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda
says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that
she was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on
then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made
to fill it again.

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt
and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another
bottle of wine. Lupin’s news seemed to have taken
them out of themselves, removed them for a while
from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were
exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by
the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he
slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone.
Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed
this, until he saw Bill’s eyes following the goblin up
the stairs.

“No ... no ... I really must get back,” said Lupin at
last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his
feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around
himself.



Page | 583 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some
pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to
know that I’ve seen you — ”



He fastened his cloak and made his farewells,
hugging the women and grasping hands with the
men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night.

“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the
kitchen together, helping clear the table. “A real
honor! Congratulations!”

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying,
Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out
the still-voluble voices of the others, who were
continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence.

“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t
been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this
full of people.”

Bill hesitated.

“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not
bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.

“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts
ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be
friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin
friends — or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.”
Again, Bill hesitated.

“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what
have you promised him in return?”

“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”

Page | 584 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was
trying to bring through more empty goblets.



“Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.”

She backed out and he closed the door again.

“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have
struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most
particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you
must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of
ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same
as human ones.”

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a
small snake had stirred inside him.

“What do you mean?” he asked.

“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said
Bill. “Dealings between wizards and goblins have been
fraught for centuries — but you’ll know all that from
History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I
would never claim that wizards have been innocent.
However, there is a belief among some goblins, and
those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that
wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and
treasure, that they have no respect for goblin
ownership.”

“I respect — ” Harry began, but Bill shook his head.

“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could
understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a
goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is
the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects
are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.”

“But if it was bought — ”

Page | 585 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“ — then they would consider it rented by the one who
had paid the money. They have, however, great
difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing
from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when
the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I
believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it
ought to have been returned to the goblins once the
original purchaser died. They consider our habit of
keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from
wizard to wizard without further payment, little more
than theft.”

Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered
whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on.

“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the
door back into the sitting room, “is to be very careful
what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less
dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a
promise to a goblin.”

“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah.
Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.”

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought
came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had
drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as
reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black
had been to him.

GRINGOTTS

Their plans were made, their preparations complete;
in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black
hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been
wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass
phial on the mantelpiece.

“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry,
nodding toward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll
be pretty convincing.”

Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting
or bite her as she picked it up.

“I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really
hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for
me. ... It’s like a bit of her.”

Harry could not help but remember how Hermione
had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand,
insisting that he was imagining things when it did not
work as well as his own, telling him to simply
practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back

Page | 587 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling



to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on
Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize
her.

“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said
Ron. “Think what that wand’s done!”

“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the
wand that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who
knows how many other people? This is the wand that
killed Sirius!”

Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the
wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to
slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword, which was
propped against the wall beside him.

“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish
Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.”

Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that
morning. She was out on the back lawn at that
moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon
sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers,
was watching rather gloomily.

Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had
once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been
surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for
him at least as well as Hermione ’s had done.
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the
secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew
what Hermione ’s problem was: She had not won the
walnut wand’s allegiance by taking it personally from
Bellatrix.

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook
entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the
sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his

Page | 588 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




action at once: He could tell that the goblin had
noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he
said, “We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff,
Griphook. We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving
tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us
off.”

They had been firm on this point, because Hermione
would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left,
and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected
about what they were about to do, the better. They
had also explained that they would not be returning.
As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that
the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them
another one. It was now packed inside the beaded
bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione
had protected from the Snatchers by the simple
expedient of stuffing it down her sock.

Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean,
not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed
over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to
escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was
tired of trying to make sure that they were not
overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark
bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook.
However, precisely how and when they were to part
from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s
sword remained a question to which Harry had no
answer. It had been impossible to decide how they
were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left
Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more
than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother
lessons,” growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers
kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill’s
warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting
that Griphook was on the watch for possible
skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the
planned double-cross that Harry had given up
Page | 589 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it;
Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to
snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up
with nothing better than “Well just have to wing it,
mate.”

Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early
hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the
night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic
and remembered a determination, almost an
excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety,
nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it
was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that
their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they
were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the
difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he
felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was
sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing
the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak.

It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could
slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the
semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where
they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn
was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was
May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering
palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing
backward and forward against the cliff: He was going
to miss the sound.

Small green shoots were forcing their way up through
the red earth of Dobby’s grave now; in a year’s time
the mound would be covered in flowers. The white
stone that bore the elf’s name had already acquired a
weathered look. He realized now that they could
hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful
place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of
leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he
wondered yet again how the elf had known where to
Page | 590 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




come to rescue them. His fingers moved
absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around
his neck, through which he could feel the jagged
mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had
seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door
opening made him look around.

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn
toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she
walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into
the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they
had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry
knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he
could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller
than he was, her long black hair rippling down her
back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested
upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard
Hermione through Bellatrix’s low voice.

“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay,
Ron, come here so I can do you. ...”

“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long



“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking
handsome — ” “It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I
liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you
did last time.”

Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under
her breath as she transformed various aspects of
Ron’s appearance. He was to be given a completely
fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent
aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile
Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the
Invisibility Cloak.

“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”

Page | 591 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise,
but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so
well. Ron’s hair was now long and wavy; he had a
thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a
short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry.

“Shall we go, then?”

All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying
dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned
and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the
boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped
working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once
past the gate, Griphook spoke.

“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”

Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his
back, his hands linked in front of Harry’s throat. He
was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the
goblin and the surprising strength with which he
clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of
the beaded bag and threw it over them both.

“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s
feet. “I can’t see a thing. Let’s go.”

Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his
shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the
Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to
Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they
moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds
later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his
eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past
wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning,
quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence.



Page | 592 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted.
Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was
polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of
warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far
corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the
shadows.

“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as
Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently.

“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept
past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the
Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.

“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as
they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard.
“You need to treat people like they’re scum!”

“Okay, okay!”

Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a
brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. At once
the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared
in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider,
finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled
street that was Diagon Alley.

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and
there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked,
cobbled street was much altered now from the
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term
at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than
ever were boarded up, though several new
establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been
created since his last visit. Harry’s own face glared
down at him from posters plastered over many
windows, always captioned with the words
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE.



Page | 593 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways.
He heard them moaning to the few passersby,
pleading for gold, insisting that they were really
wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed
Hermione. They seemed to melt away before her,
drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as
they could. Hermione looked after them curiously,
until the man with the bloodied bandage came
staggering right across her path.

“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice
was cracked, high-pitched; he sounded distraught.
“Where are my children? What has he done with
them? You know, you know\”

“I — I really — ” stammered Hermione.

The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then,
with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown
backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood
there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock
visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the
windows on either side of the street, while a little knot
of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes
about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to
vacate the scene.

Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have
been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry
wondered whether it might not be better to leave now
and try to think of a different plan. Before they could
move or consult one another, however, they heard a
cry from behind them.

“Why, Madam Lestrange!”



Page | 594 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his
hold around Harry’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a
crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was
striding toward them.

“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but
at that moment Harry could not think who Travers
was. Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest
height and said with as much contempt as she could
muster:

“And what do you want?”

Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.

“ He’s another Death Eater\” breathed Griphook, and
Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into
Hermione ’s ear.

“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly,
“but if my presence is not welcome ...”

Harry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of
the Death Eaters who had been summoned to
Xenophilius’s house.

“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly,
trying to cover up her mistake. “How are you?”

“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and
about, Bellatrix.”

“Really? Why?” asked Hermione.

“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants
of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the
... ah ... escape.”



Page | 595 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was
true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in
public —

“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him
most faithfully in the past,” said Hermione in a
magnificent imitation of Bellatrix’s most
contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as
good with him as mine is, Travers.”

Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also
seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at the man
Ron had just Stunned.

“How did it offend you?”

“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said
Hermione coolly.

“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said
Travers. “While they do nothing but beg I have no
objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead
her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m a witch, sir, I’m
a witch, let me prove it to youV ” he said in a squeaky
impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand
— but whose wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you
using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own
was — ”

“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding
up Bellatrix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you
have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly
misinformed.”

Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he
turned instead to Ron.

“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.”



Page | 596 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had
decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover
for Ron to assume. “He speaks very little English, but
he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has
traveled here from Transylvania to see our new
regime.”

“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?”

“ ’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand.

Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand
as though frightened of dirtying himself.

“So what brings you and your — ah — sympathetic
friend to Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers.

“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione.

“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We
cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the
necessity of consorting with our long-fingered
friends.”

Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten
momentarily around his neck.

“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.

Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside
him and head along the crooked, cobbled street
toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts
stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped
along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.

A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they
needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers
marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side,
there was no means for Harry to communicate with

Page | 597 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot
of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze
doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the
liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had
been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were
clutching long thin golden rods.

“Ah, Probity Probes,” sighed Travers theatrically, “so
crude — but effective!”

And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to
the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed
them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew,
detected spells of concealment and hidden magical
objects. Knowing that he had only seconds; Harry
pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn
and murmured, “Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by
Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at
the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as
the spells hit them.

Hermione ’s long black hair rippled behind her as she
climbed the steps.

“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his
Probe.

“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in
Bellatrix’s commanding, arrogant voice. Travers
looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was
confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe
and then at his companion, who said in a slightly
dazed voice,

“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.”

Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and
Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry



Page | 598 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




glanced back as they crossed the threshold: The
wizards were both scratching their heads.

Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were
made of silver and which carried the poem warning of
dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up
at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came
to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he
had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his
life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “ Like I
said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had
seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted
repository of a trove of gold he had never known he
possessed, and never for an instant could he have
dreamed that he would return to steal. ... But within
seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of
the bank.

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on
high stools, serving the first customers of the day.
Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old
goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through
an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead
of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall
to Ron.

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said
to nobody in particular, “Leprechaun,” and then
greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key,
which was examined and given back to him.

Hermione stepped forward.

“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently
startled. “Dear me! How — how may I help you
today?”

“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione.



Page | 599 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced
around. Not only was Travers hanging back,
watching, but several other goblins had looked up
from their work to stare at Hermione.

“You have ... identification?” asked the goblin.

“Identification? I — I have never been asked for
identification before!” said Hermione.

“ They know\” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear.
“They must have been warned there might be an
impostor !”

“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held
out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast
of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts
were aware that Bellatrix’s wand had been stolen.

“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s
ear, “the Imperius Cursel”

Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak,
pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the
first time in his life, “Imperiol”

A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling
of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind,
down the sinews and veins connecting him to the
wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took
Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then said,
“Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam
Lestrange!”

“What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine — ”

“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter
again; still the goblins all around were watching. “But



Page | 600 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




how could you have done, which wandmaker did you
use?”

Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at
Travers, he muttered, “Imperiol” once more.

“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at
Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome. And is it
working well? I always think wands require a little
breaking in, don’t you?”

Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s
enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of
events without comment.

The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands
and a younger goblin approached.

“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who
dashed away and returned a moment later with a
leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal,
which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! So, if you
will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin,
hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight,

“I shall take you to your vault.”

He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging
happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag
still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with
his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing
attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding
Travers with confusion.

“Wait — Bogrod!”

Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.



Page | 601 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to
Hermione. “Forgive me, Madam, but there have been
special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.”

He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the
Imperiused goblin shook him off.

“I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange
wishes to visit her vault. ... Very old family ... old
clients ... This way, please ...”

And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many
doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at
Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking
abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a
flick of his wand he made Travers come with them,
walking meekly in their wake as they reached the
door and passed into the rough stone passageway
beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.

“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the
door slammed behind them and he pulled off the
Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his
shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the
slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry
Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added,
in response to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries
about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now
standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I did it
strongly enough, I don’t know. ...”

And another memory darted through his mind, of the
real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had
first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to
mean them, Potter!”

“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now,
while we can?”



Page | 602 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the
door into the main hall, beyond which who knew
what was happening.

“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry.

“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control
the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will
not be room for the wizard.”

Harry pointed his wand at Travers.

“Imperio\”

The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at
a smart pace.

“What are you making him do?”

“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod,
who whistled to summon a little cart that came
trundling along the tracks toward them out of the
darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting
behind them in the main hall as they all clambered
into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron,
and Hermione crammed together in the back.

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They
hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack
in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning
through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward
all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the
rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind
him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever
deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back.

They might as well have left enormous footprints
behind them; the more he thought about it, the more
foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as



Page | 603 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand,
when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it —

They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated
within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed
and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a
waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard
Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They
zoomed through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and
mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an
awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all
thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into
pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione
shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward
the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly
on the rocky passage floor.

“C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron
pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw
that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood
there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely
herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again.

They were realizing it as they looked at each other,
feeling their own faces.

“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to
his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the
tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than
water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical
concealment! They know there are impostors in
Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!”

Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the
beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under
his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility
Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his
head in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to
have lifted the Imperius Curse.



Page | 604 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the
vault without a Gringotts goblin. And we need the
Clankers!”

“Imperiol” Harry said again; his voice echoed through
the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady
control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod
submitted once more to his will, his befuddled
expression changing to one of polite indifference, as
Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.

“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said
Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the
waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield
Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up
the passageway.

“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way,

Griphook!”

“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as
they hurried on foot into the darkness after the
goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog.

“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry.
He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear
something clanking and moving around nearby.
“Griphook, how much farther?”

“Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...”

And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which
Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all
of them to a halt.

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front
of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest
vaults in the place. The beast’s scales had turned pale
and flaky during its long incarceration under the

Page | 605 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




ground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore
heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs
driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked
wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the
chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its
ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that
made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a
jet of fire that sent them running back up the
passageway.

“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even
more savage for that. However, we have the means to
control it. It has learned what to expect when the
Clankers come. Give them to me.”

Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin
pulled out a number of small metal instruments that
when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like
miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them
out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.

“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron,
and Hermione. “It will expect pain when it hears the
noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm
upon the door of the vault.”

They advanced around the corner again, shaking the
Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls,
grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry’s skull
seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out
another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see
it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the
scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and
guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords
when it heard the sound of the Clankers.

“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook
urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon
Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to

Page | 606 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to
reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to
ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor,
the skins of strange creatures — some with long
spines, others with drooping wings — potions in
jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.

“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside
the vault.

He had described Hufflepuff’s cup to Ron and
Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux
that resided in this vault, he did not know what it
looked like. He barely had time to glance around,
however, before there was a muffled clunk from
behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them
inside the vault, and they were plunged into total
darkness.

“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said
Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your
wands, can’t you? And hurry, we have very little
time!”

“Lumosl”

Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam
fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of
Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of
chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too,
and were now examining the piles of objects
surrounding them.

“Harry, could this be — ? Aargh!”

Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his
wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling
from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower
of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter,

Page | 607 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every
direction, the original impossible to discern amongst
them.

“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her
blistered fingers.

“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!”
said Griphook. “Everything you touch will burn and
multiply, but the copies are worthless — and if you
continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually
be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”

“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately,
but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of
the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more
exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot,
part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot
metal.

“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at
Ron.

“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s
small and gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two
handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw’s
symbol anywhere, the eagle — ”

They directed their wands into every nook and
crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was
impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry
sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground
where they joined the goblets, and now there was
scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold
blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace.
Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-
made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling;
higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly



Page | 608 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




it found an object that made his heart skip and his
hand tremble.



“It’s there, it’s up there\”

Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so
that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way
spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga
Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of
Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by
Tom Riddle.

“And how the hell are we going to get up there
without touching anything?” asked Ron.

“Accio Cup\” cried Hermione, who had evidently
forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told
them during their planning sessions.

“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin.

“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the
goblin. “If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll
have to help us more than — wait! Can I touch stuff
with the sword? Hermione, give it here!”

Hermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the
beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then
removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its
rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver
flagon nearby, which did not multiply.

“If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but
how am I going to get up there?”

The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach
for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat
from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat
ran down Harry’s face and back as he struggled to

Page | 609 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the
dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and
the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.

They were truly trapped now: There was no way out
except through the door, and a horde of goblins
seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry
looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their
faces.

“Hermione,” said Harry as the clanking grew louder,
“I’ve got to get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it — ”

She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and
whispered, “Levicorpus.”

Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of
armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot
bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of
pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were
knocked aside into other objects, which also began to
replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot
treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust
the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff’s cup,
hooking it onto the blade.

“Impervius\” screeched Hermione in an attempt to
protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning
metal.

Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down:

Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure,
struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the
rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and
nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in
view.

Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The
blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling.

Page | 610 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Liberacorpus\” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and
Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling
treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry’s hand.

“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot
metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his
shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling
mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword? It had
the cup on it!”

The clanking on the other side of the door was
growing deafening — it was too late —

“There!”

It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who
lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the
goblin had never expected them to keep their word.
One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s hair, to
make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of
burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword
and swung it high out of Harry’s reach.

The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the
sword’s blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still
astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although
he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish
it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from
his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding
uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery
gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into
the outer chamber.

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his
body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating
treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and
reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was
gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he
Page | 611 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling
could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the
surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and
crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!” He vanished
into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom
were holding daggers and who accepted him without
question.

Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet
and knew that the only way out was through.

“Stupefyl” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined
in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and
some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry
saw several wizard guards running around the
corner.

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of
flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled-
up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or
madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the
thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled,
“Relashiol”

The cuffs broke open with loud bangs.

“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning
Spells at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward
the blind dragon.

“Harry — Harry — what are you doing?” cried
Hermione.

“Get up, climb up, come on — ”

The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s
foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled
himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as
steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched
out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron
Page | 612 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




climbed on behind them, and a second later the
dragon became aware that it was untethered.

With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees,
clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales
as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins
aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against
the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening,
while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that
glanced off its flanks.

“Well never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed,
but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame
again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling
cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon
clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes were
shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the
crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only
cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any
moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodiol”

She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway,
carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward
the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking
goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the
ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed
the underground lake, and the great crawling,
snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space
ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of
the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of
rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking
of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled,
while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress
clear —

And then at last, by the combined force of their spells
and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted
their way out of the passage into the marble hallway.

Page | 613 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and
finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings:
Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it
could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with
Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it
forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them
buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it
staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into
the sky.



Page | 614 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling





THE FINAL HIDING PLACE

There was no means of steering; the dragon could not
see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it
turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it
impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless,
as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling
below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry’s
overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape
that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the
beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and
the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and
blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like
the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from
delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at
the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be
sobbing.

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his
immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw
them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting
as far away from its underground prison as possible;
but the question of how and when they were to
dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea

Page | 615 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling



how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how
this particular dragon, which could barely see, would
locate a good place to put down. He glanced around
constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar
prickling. ...

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they
had broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon
would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How
quickly would they realize what had been taken? And
then, when they discovered that the golden cup was
missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they
were hunting Horcruxes. ...

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It
climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps
of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out
the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and
out of the capital. On and on they flew, over
countryside parceled out in patches of green and
brown, over roads and rivers winding through the
landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon.

“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as
they flew farther and farther north.

“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb
with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip.
He had been wondering for some time what they
would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if
the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and
numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty.
When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten?
Surely it would need sustenance before long? And
what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly
edible humans sitting on its back?

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning
indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns

Page | 616 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous
shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud.
Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on
to the dragon’s back.

“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a
considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing
height?”

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains
and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The landscape
seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he
squinted over the side of the dragon, and he
wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh
water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.

Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling
circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller
lakes.

“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called
back to the others. “Straight into the water before it
realizes we’re here!”

They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry
could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling
in the surface of the water.

“NOW!”

He slithered over the side of the dragon and
plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake;
the drop was greater than he had estimated and he
hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward
the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous
ripples emanating in circles from the places where
Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not
seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty
Page | 617 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up
water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione
emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of
the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard,
and landed at last on a distant bank.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite
shore. The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was
more a question of fighting their way through reeds
and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped,
sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering.
Though Harry could have happily lain down and
slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and
started casting the usual protective spells around
them.

When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the
first time that he had seen them properly since
escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all
over their faces and arms, and their clothing was
singed away in places. They were wincing as they
dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries.
Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out
three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from
Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them.

They changed and then gulped down the juice.

“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was
sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, “we got
the Horcrux. On the downside — ”

“ — no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he
dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans
onto the angry burn beneath.

“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little
scab ...”

Page | 618 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet
jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the
grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew
their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.

“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit
weird hanging round our necks,” said Ron, wiping his
mouth on the back of his hand.

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank,
where the dragon was still drinking.

“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will
it be all right?”

“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon,
Hermione, it can look after itself. It’s us we need to
worry about.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said
Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke
into Gringotts.”

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it
was difficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt
lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass
beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his
throat was raw.

“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione
finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll
know, won’t he? You- Know- Who will know we know
about his Horcruxes!”

“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron
hopefully. “Maybe they’ll cover up — ”



Page | 619 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s
voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head
like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit
room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on
the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.

“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and
cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one
thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true, he
could not see how ...

The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes
high above his.

“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “ Say it again).”

“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes
wide with terror, “m-my Lord ... we t-tried t-to st-stop
them. ... Im-impostors, my Lord ... broke — broke
into the — into the Lestranges’ v-vault. ...”

“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had
ways of revealing impostors? Who were they?”

“It was ... it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two
accomplices. ...”

“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible
fear gripping him. “Tell me! What did they take?”

“A ... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord ...”

The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a
stranger’s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be
true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How
was it possible that the boy could have discovered his
secret?



Page | 620 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green
light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin
rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered
before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy
threw others behind them in their race for the door,
and again and again his wand fell, and those who
were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this
news, for hearing about the golden cup —

Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down,
and they passed before him in vision: his treasures,
his safeguards, his anchors to immortality — the
diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if,
what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he
know, had he already acted, had he traced more of
them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this?
Dumbledore, who had always suspected him;
Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose
wand was his now, yet who reached out from the
ignominy of death through the boy, the boy —

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his
Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known,
would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all;
he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore
and of how many other worthless, nameless men:
How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he,
himself, most important and precious, had been
attacked, mutilated?

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been
destroyed, but he had thought that was because he
had no body to feel, being less than ghost. ... No,
surely, the rest were safe. ... The other Horcruxes
must be intact. ...

But he must know, he must be sure. ... He paced the
room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed,



Page | 621 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling
brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts —

A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could
the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the
Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be
related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection,
the killings had never been traced to him: The ring,
surely, was safe.

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about
the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the
locket being stolen was absurd. ...

As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts
he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had
plumbed the deepest secrets of that place. ...

And there was still Nagini, who must remain close
now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his
protection. ...

But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to
each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection
around each of his Horcruxes. ... A job, like the quest
for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone ...

Which should he visit first, which was in most
danger? An old unease flickered inside him.
Dumbledore had known his middle name. ...
Dumbledore might have made the connection with
the Gaunts. ... Their abandoned home was, perhaps,
the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that
he would go first. ...

The lake, surely impossible ... though was there a
slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known
some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage.



Page | 622 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there
was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter
Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school.
Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to
the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ...
To tell Snape why the boy might return would be
foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust
Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and
carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take
Nagini with him: He would not be parted from the
snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room,
through the hall, and out into the dark garden where
the fountain played; he called the snake in
Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a
long shadow. ...

Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back
to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in
the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking
down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by
the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden
excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed
unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely
surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw
the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and
the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun.

“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low
after Voldemort’s high screams. “He knows, and he’s
going to check where the others are, and the last
one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I
knew it. I knew it.”

“What?”

Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking
worried.

“But what did you see? How do you know?”



“I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his
head, he’s” — Harry remembered the killings — “he’s
seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand
how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others
are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is
safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard
not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one
last, but he could still be there within hours — ”

“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron,
now scrambling to his feet too.

“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he
didn’t think about exactly where it is — ”

“Wait, wait\” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the
Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak
again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we
need to — ”

“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had
been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into
the new tent, but that was impossible now. “Can you
imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the
ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the
Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?”

“But how are we going to get in?”

“Well go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work
something out once we see what the protection
around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak,
Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”

“But we don’t really fit — ”

“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”

The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the
black water: The dragon had drunk its fill and risen
into the air. They paused in their preparations to
watch it climb higher and higher, now black against
the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a
nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward
and took her place between the other two. Harry
pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and
together they turned on the spot into the crushing
darkness.

THE MISSING MIRROR

Harry’s feet touched road. He saw the achingly
familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts,
and the outline of black mountains beyond the
village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off
toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows
of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the
heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he
had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a
desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second,
upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip
upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like
Voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been
stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and he
knew immediately that their appearance had caused
it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the
Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open
and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters
dashed into the street, their wands aloft.



Page | 626 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling



Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there
were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it
would give away their position. One of the Death
Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still
echoing around the distant mountains.

“Accio Cloak).” roared one of the Death Eaters.

Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to
escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.

“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the
Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then to his
fellows, “Spread out. He’s here.”

Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron,
and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the
nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed
them by inches. They waited in the darkness,
listening to the footsteps running up and down,
beams of light flying along the street from the Death
Eaters’ searching wands.

“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate
now!”

“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a
Death Eater shouted,

“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting
away! We’ll find you!”

“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set
up that spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve
done something to keep us here, trap us — ”

“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater.
“Let ’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!”



Page | 627 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his



“ — an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord
wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if
he’s been Kissed first!”

There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry:

To repel dementors they would have to produce
Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.

“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!”
Hermione whispered.

Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to
steal over the street. Light was sucked from the
environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In
the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his
arm and together, they turned on the spot.

The air through which they needed to move seemed to
have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the
Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold
was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He,
Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street,
groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a
sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly,
came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because
they were of a denser darkness than their
surroundings, with their black cloaks and their
scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in
the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be
coming more quickly now, taking those dragging,
rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the
air, closing in —

He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer
the Dementor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It

Page | 628 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he
whispered, “Expecto Patronum).”

The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The
dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell
from somewhere out of sight.

“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus,
it was a stag!

The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping
out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were
becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could
decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts
nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the
narrow street, and a rough voice said, “Potter, in here,
quick!”

He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them
hurtled through the open doorway.

“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a
tall figure, passing them on his way into the street
and slamming the door behind him.

Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he
saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the
grubby, sawdust- strewn bar of the Hog’s Head Inn.
They ran behind the counter and through a second
doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that
they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened
onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a
small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil
painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room
with a kind of vacant sweetness.

Shouts reached them from the street below. Still
wearing the Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the
grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom

Page | 629 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman,
was the only person not wearing a hood.

“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded
faces. “So what? You send dementors down my street,
I’ll send a Patronus back at ’em! I’m not having ’em
near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!”

“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater.

“That was a stag, it was Potter’s!”

“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand.
“Stag! You idiot — Expecto Patronum .!”

Something huge and horned erupted from the wand:
Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out
of sight.

“That’s not what I saw — ” said the Death Eater,
though with less certainty.

“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of
his companions told the barman. “Someone was out
in the street against regulations — ”

“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to
your curfew!”

“ You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”

“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill
me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it,
then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you
haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and
summoned him. He’s not going to like being called
here for me and my old cat, is he, now?”

“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death
Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!”

Page | 630 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons
when my pub’s closed down? What’ll happen to your
little sidelines then?”



“Are you threatening — ?”



“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t
it?”



“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first
Death Eater.

“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”

“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death
Eater. “Break curfew again and we won’t be so
lenient!”

The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street.
Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under
the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair.
Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the
Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the
barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar,
then climbing the stairs.

Harry’s attention was caught by something on the
mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on
top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.

The barman entered the room.

“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to
the other of them. “What were you thinking, coming
here?”

“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you
enough. You saved our lives.”

Page | 631 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking
up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy,
wire-gray hair and beard. He wore spectacles. Behind
the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant
blue.

“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”

There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman
looked at each other.

“You sent Dobby.”

The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.

“Thought he’d be with you. Where Ve you left him?”

“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed
him.”

The barman’s face was impassive. After a few
moments he said, “I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that
elf.”

He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his
wand, not looking at any of them.

“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.

He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light
the fire.

“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across
to Sirius’s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken
nearly two years before. “Bought it from Dung ’bout a
year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me what it was.
Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”

Ron gasped.

Page | 632 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”

“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth.

“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”

“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son.
Haven’t I just proved my Patronus is a goat?”

“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah ... well, I’m hungry!” he added
defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.

“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the
room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of
bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which
he set upon a small table in front of the fire.

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there
was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of
goblets, and the sound of chewing.

“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten
their fill, and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in
their chairs. “We need to think of the best way to get
you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard
what happens if anyone moves outdoors during
darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be
onto you like bow-truckles on doxy eggs. I don’t
reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second
time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you
can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get
right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and
you’ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid.
He’s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever
since they tried to arrest him.”

“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into
Hogwarts.”

“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.

Page | 633 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“We’ve got to,” said Harry.



“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning
forward, “is to get as far from here as you can.”

“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve
got to get into the castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your
brother — wanted us — ”

The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth ’s
glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and
Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider,
Aragog.

“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said
Aberforth, “and people had a habit of getting hurt
while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get
away from this school, Potter, and out of the country
if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes.
He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you
don’t owe him anything.”

“You don’t understand,” said Harry again.

“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think
I understood my own brother? Think you knew Albus
better than I did?”

“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt
sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food
and wine. “It’s ... he left me a job.”

“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope?
Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you’d expect an
unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without
overstretching themselves?”

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking
strained.

Page | 634 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to — ”

“ ‘Got to’? Why ‘got to*? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said
Aberforth roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow
him! Save yourself!”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I — ” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so
he took the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too,
you’re in the Order of the Phoenix — ”

“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is
finished. You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone
who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves. It’ll
never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too
badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself.

Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at
Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they
live now everyone knows they’ve been working with
you.”

“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job — ”

“Give it to someone else!”

“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all



“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was
he honest with you?”

Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but
somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips.
Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking.



Page | 635 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our
mother’s knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew
up, and Albus ... he was a natural.”

The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl
over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked
around properly, the only picture in the room. There
was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of
anyone else.

“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is
that your sister? Ariana?”

“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita
Skeeter, have you, missy?”

Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that
Hermione had turned red.

“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry,
trying to spare Hermione.

“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another
swig of mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my
brother’s every orifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of
people, you three included, by the looks of it.”

Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the
doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had
riddled him for months now. He had made his choice
while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to
continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated
for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had
not been told everything that he wanted to know, but
simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he
did not want to hear anything that would deflect him
from his purpose. He met Aberforth ’s gaze, which was
so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes
gave the same impression that they were X-raying the
Page | 636 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that
Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised
him for it.

“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very
much,” said Hermione in a low voice.

“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how
many of the people my brother cared about very
much ended up in a worse state than if he’d left ’em
well alone.”

“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.

“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.

“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said
Hermione. “Are you — are you talking about your
sister?”

Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were
chewing the words he was holding back. Then he
burst into speech.

“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked,
set upon, by three Muggle boys. They’d seen her
doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge:
She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or
wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I
expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and
when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit
carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”

Hermione ’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked
slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and
suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his
pain.



Page | 637 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right
again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get
rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it
exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and
at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly
she was sweet and scared and harmless.

“And my father went after the bastards that did it,”
said Aberforth, “and attacked them. And they locked
him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d
done it, because if the Ministry had known what
Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St.
Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious
threat to the International Statute of Secrecy,
unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of
her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any
longer.

“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house,
put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after
her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.

“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a
grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through
Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not Albus,
he was always up in his bedroom when he was home,
reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up
with his correspondence with ‘the most notable
magical names of the day,’ ” Aberforth sneered. “He
didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me
best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for
my mother, I could get her to calm down when she
was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she
used to help me feed the goats.

“Then, when she was fourteen ... See, I wasn’t there,”
said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed
her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother
wasn’t as young as she was, and ... it was an

Page | 638 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother
was killed.”

Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he
did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept
talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been
since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he
had ever spoken about it.

“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with
little Doge. The pair of ’em came home for my
mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own,
and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”

Aberforth spat into the fire.

“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care
about school, I’d have stayed home and done it. He
told me I had to finish my education and he’d take
over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr.
Brilliant, there’s no prizes for looking after your half-
mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every
other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till
he came.”

And now a positively dangerous look crept over
Aberforth’s face.

“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to
talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he
was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then,
while they were hatching all their plans for a new
Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and
whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand
plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one
young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when
Albus was working for the greater good?



Page | 639 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It
was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I
told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you,
now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it
took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry
and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him,
you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s
in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it
is you’re planning to go, when you’re making your
clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a
following. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his
eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the
lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind
again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got
angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was,
trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant
brother. ... Didn’t I understand, my poor sister
wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the
world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught
the Muggles their place?

“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my
wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus
Curse used on me by my brother’s best friend — and
Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us
were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs
set her off, she couldn’t stand it — ”

The color was draining from Aberforth ’s face as
though he had suffered a mortal wound.

“ — and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t
really know what she was doing, and I don’t know
which of us did it, it could have been any of us — and
she was dead.”

His voice broke on the last word and he dropped
down into the nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet
with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth.

Page | 640 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had
not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of
it.

“I’m so ... I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered.

“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.

“ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a
track record already, back in his own country, and he
didn’t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus
was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister,
free to become the greatest wizard of the — ”

“He was never free,” said Harry.

“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.

“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died,
he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He
started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t
there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please ... hurt me instead.’ ”

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had
never gone into details about what had happened on
the island on the lake: The events that had taken
place after he and Dumbledore had returned to
Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.

“He thought he was back there with you and
Grindelwald, I know he did,” said Harry, remembering
Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. “He thought he
was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . .
It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you
wouldn’t say he was free.”



Page | 641 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own
knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said,
“How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn’t
more interested in the greater good than in you? How
can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my
little sister?”

A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.

“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said
Hermione.

“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back
Aberforth. “Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of
yourself, here’s how to survive’?”

“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer,
“sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your
own safety! Sometimes you’ve got to think about the
greater good! This is war!”

“You’re seventeen, boy!”

“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if
you’ve given up!”

“Who says I’ve given up?”

“ The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’ ” Harry
repeated. “ Tou- Know- Who’s won, it’s over, and
anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding
themselves.’ ”

“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”

“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to
finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge
on to me. I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or



Page | 642 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end.
I’ve known it for years.”



He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did
not. He merely scowled.

“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If
you can’t help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in
peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can
help us — well, now would be a great time to mention
it.”

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry
with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his
brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet,
walked around the little table, and approached the
portrait of Ariana.

“You know what to do,” he said.

She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people
in portraits usually did, out of the sides of their
frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel
painted behind her. They watched her slight figure
retreating until finally she was swallowed by the
darkness.

“Er — what — ?” began Ron.

“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You
must know they’ve got all the old secret passageways
covered at both ends, dementors all around the
boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from
what my sources tell me. The place has never been so
heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once
you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the
Carrows as his deputies ... well, that’s your lookout,
isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.”

“But what ... ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s
picture.

A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the
painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back
toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came.
But there was somebody else with her now, someone
taller than she was, who was limping along, looking
excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen
it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his
face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and
larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and
shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing
swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the
entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it,
his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped,
clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a
roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and
yelled, “I knew you’d come! I knew it, HarryY’

THE LOST DIADEM

“Neville — what the — how — ?”

But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with
yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer
Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One
of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were
gouge marks on his face, and his general air of
unkemptness suggested that he had been living
rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I
knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter
of time!”

“Neville, what’s happened to you?”

“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a
shake of the head. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse.
You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,” he turned to
Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people
on the way.”



Page | 645 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling



“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What
d’you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a
curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole
village!”

“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into
the bar,” said Neville. “Just send them down the
passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.”

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her
to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel;
Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed
Aberforth.

“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our
lives twice.”

“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might
not be able to save ’em a third time.”

Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and
through the hole behind Ariana’s portrait. There were
smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as
though the passageway had been there for years.
Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor
was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows
rippled, fanlike, across the wall.

“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set
off. “It isn’t on the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I
thought there were only seven passages in and out of
school?”

“They sealed off all of those before the start of the
year,” said Neville. “There’s no chance of getting
through any of them now, not with curses over the
entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at
the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming,
drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. ... Is it true?
Page | 646 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a
dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it,
Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about
it in the Great Hall at dinner!”

“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry.

Neville laughed gleefully.

“What did you do with the dragon?”

“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was
all for keeping it as a pet — ”

“Don’t exaggerate, Ron — ”

“But what have you been doing? People have been
saying you’ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t
think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”

“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about
Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.”

“It’s been ... well, it’s not really like Hogwarts
anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face
as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”

“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in
charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the
Carrows.”

“Like Umbridge?”

“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers
are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do
anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can avoid
it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.

Page | 647 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be
Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just
the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions



“What?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up
and down the passage.

“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he
pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I
refused to do it. Some people are into it, though;
Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been
top in anything, I expect.

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies,
which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to
listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals,
stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into
hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the
natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,”
he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her
how much Muggle blood she and her brother have
got.”

“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place
for getting a smart mouth.”

“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have
stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people
stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to
notice that when you did it, Harry.”

“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said
Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and
Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.



Page | 648 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Neville shrugged.



“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much
pure blood, so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy
but they won’t actually kill us.”

Harry did not know what was worse, the things that
Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which
he said them.

“The only people in real danger are the ones whose
friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble.
They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was
getting a bit too outspoken in The Quihhler, so they
dragged Luna off the train on the way back for
Christmas.”

“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her — ”

“Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.”

From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry
recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that
Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another
messages.

“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at
Hermione. “The Carrows never rumbled how we were
communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak
out at night and put graffiti on the walls:

Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that.
Snape hated it.”

“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past
tense.

“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said
Neville. “We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never
came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort

Page | 649 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was
behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me
hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught
releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they
tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.”

“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to
slope upward.

“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what
Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But
we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right
up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they
decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose,
and they went for Gran.”

“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione
together.

“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the
passage was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see
their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping
kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was
only a matter of time before they did it the other way
around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was
astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a
bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old
witch living alone, they probably thought they didn’t
need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,”
Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and
Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a
hand to the breast pocket of his robes, “telling me she
was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to
keep it up.”

“Cool,” said Ron.

“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once
they realized they had no hold over me, they decided

Page | 650 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know
whether they were planning to kill me or send me to
Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.”

“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t
— aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”

“ ’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”

They turned a corner and there ahead of them was
the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps
led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana’s
portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through.
As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen
people:

“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”

As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage,
there were several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s
Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!” “Hermionel”

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of
lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron,
and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the
back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what
seemed to be more than twenty people: They might
just have won a Quidditch final.

“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the
crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their
surroundings.

He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous,
and looked rather like the interior of a particularly
sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s
cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the
ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark
wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were
Page | 651 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the
gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black
badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the
bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and
green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were
bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped
against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-
cased wireless.

“Where are we?”

“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville.
“Surpassed itself, hasn’t it? The Carrows were
chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a
hideout: I managed to get through the door and this
is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I
arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one
hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it’s
expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.”

“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking
around for the door.

“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not
recognized until he spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised
and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long as one of us
stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t
open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room.
You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like,

‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get
in’ — and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make
sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s the man!”

“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville
modestly. “I’d been in here about a day and a half,
and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get
something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the
Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met
Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food, because
Page | 652 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t
really do.”



“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to
Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron
to general astonishment.

“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,”
said Seamus, “and it just makes more hammocks
every time we need them, and it even sprouted a
pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —



“ — and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,”
supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not
noticed until that point. Now that he looked around
properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both
Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie
Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.

“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie.
“There’ve been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to
keep up with you on Potterwatch.” He pointed at the
wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?”

“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”

There was a smattering of applause and a few
whoops; Ron took a bow.

“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.

Before any of them could parry the question with one
of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in
the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on
the curious and delighted faces, the Room of
Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a
ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were
ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay
Page | 653 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s
scream of fury vibrated inside his head.

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s
mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the
Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face
and Ron holding him up.

“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want
to sit down? I expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?”

“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione,
trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had
just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes.
Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit
Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.

“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions
told him that they understood.

“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked
Seamus. “What’s the plan?”

“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his
willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to
Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning. “Well,
there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and I — need
to do, and then we’ll get out of here.”

Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville
looked confused.

“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”

“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing
his scar, trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something
important we need to do — ”

“What is it?”

Page | 654 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“I — I can’t tell you.”



There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s
brows contracted.

“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with
fighting You-Know-Who, right?”

“Well, yeah — ”

“Then we’ll help you.”

The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were
nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A
couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate
their willingness for immediate action.

“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said
that a lot in the last few hours. “We — we can’t tell
you. We’ve got to do it — alone.”

“Why?” asked Neville.

“Because ...” In his desperation to start looking for
the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private
discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they
might commence their search, Harry found it difficult
to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing.
“Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said
carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean,
he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.”

“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army.
We were all in it together, we’ve been keeping it going
while you three have been off on your own — ”

“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.



Page | 655 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t
trust us. Everyone in this room’s been fighting and
they’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were
hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re
loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.”

“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was
going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door
had just opened behind him.

“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I
thought you must be here!”

It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of
delight and ran to hug his best friend.

“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be
back!”

“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing
here? How did you — ?”

“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake
Galleon. “I promised her and Ginny that if you turned
up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came
back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to
overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”

“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly.
“Isn’t it, Harry? We’re going to fight them out of
Hogwarts?”

“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m
sorry, but that’s not what we came back for. There’s
something we’ve got to do, and then — ”

“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded
Michael Corner.



Page | 656 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit
everyone in the end, it’s all about trying to get rid of
You-Know-Who — ”



“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be
a part of it!”

There was another noise behind them, and Harry
turned. His heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now
climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed
by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a
radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully
appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never
been less pleased to see her.

“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising
his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. “He
wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway
station.”

Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan
came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at
him.

“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake
Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael
Corner.

“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George.

“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the
sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take
everything in while his scar was still burning so
fiercely.

“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My
favorite kind,” said Fred.



Page | 657 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did
you call them all back for? This is insane — ”

“We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his
fake Galleon. “The message said Harry was back, and
we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a wand, though



“You haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus.

Ron turned suddenly to Harry.

“Why can’t they help?”

“What?”

“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so
that none of them could hear but Hermione, who
stood between them, “We don’t know where it is.
We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s
a Horcrux.”

Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured,
“I think Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re
looking for, we need them.” And when Harry looked
unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone,
Harry.”

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head
threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned
him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione
about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we
grew up, and Albus ...he was a natural. ... Was he
turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets
clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But
Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that
led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ...



Page | 658 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he
called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred
and George, who had been cracking jokes for the
benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them
looked alert, excited.

“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said.
“Something — something that’ll help us overthrow
You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t
know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw.

Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone
ever come across something with her eagle on it, for
instance?”

He looked hopefully toward the little group of
Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but
it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of
Ginny’s chair.

“Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it,
remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.”

“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner,
rolling his eyes, “is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the
point.”

“When was it lost?” asked Harry.

“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart
sank. “Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished
with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,” she
appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever
found a trace of it, have they?”

They all shook their heads.

“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.



Page | 659 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s
was supposed to have magical properties, enhance
the wisdom of the wearer.”

“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons — ”

But Harry cut across Luna.

“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks
like it?”

They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron
and Hermione and his own disappointment was
mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost
this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem
like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the
castle. ... Before he could formulate a new question,
however, Cho spoke again.

“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to
look like, I could take you up to our common room
and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her
statue.”

Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room
of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead
the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great
snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was
flying again, whether to the underground lake or here,
to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was
hardly any time left.

“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and
Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them.
“Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m going
to go and look at this statue, at least find out what
the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you
know — the other one — safe.”



Page | 660 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather
fiercely, “No, Luna will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?”

“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho
sat down again, looking disappointed.

“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville.

“Over here.”

He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small
cupboard opened onto a steep staircase.

“It comes out somewhere different every day, so
they’ve never been able to find it,” he said. “Only
trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to
end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re
always patrolling the corridors at night.”

“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”

He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was
long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected
places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid
wall.

“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the
Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them.

He gave the wall a little push.

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside:
Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself
at once. They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry
pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the
pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s
Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and
located his and Luna’s dots at last.



Page | 661 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching
Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead.
“Come on, this way.”

They crept off.

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times
before, but never had his heart hammered this fast,
never had so much depended on his safe passage
through the place. Through squares of moonlight
upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets
creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around
corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry
and Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map
whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a
ghost to pass without drawing attention to
themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at
any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he
strained his ears with every step to hear the first,
telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.

“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve
and pulling him toward a spiral staircase.

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had
never been up here before. At last they reached a
door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing
but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze
knocker in the shape of an eagle.

Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie
floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She
knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry
like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle
opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical
voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the
flame?”



Page | 662 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna,
looking thoughtful.

“What? Isn’t there just a password?”

“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna.

“What if you get it wrong?”

“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it
right,” said Luna. “That way you learn, you see?”

“Yeah ... Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for
anyone else, Luna.”

“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well
then, I think the answer is that a circle has no
beginning.”

“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung
open.

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide,
circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at
Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the
walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks:

By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular
view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was
domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in
the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs,
and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door
stood a tall statue of white marble.

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he
had seen at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a
door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He
strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed
to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her
face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-
P a g e | 663 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top
of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had
worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched
into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and
climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.

“ ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ”

“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a
cackling voice.

Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and
landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of
Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as
Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby
forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her
forearm.

THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE

The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s
scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from
sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock
beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him
and there was triumph in his heart — They have the
boy.

A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood:
Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before
him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so
hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.

“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A.
lessons,” said Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That
was noisier than I thought it would be.”

And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble.
Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder
from behind the door leading to the dormitories:
Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.

“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”

Page | 665 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling



Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to
her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as
the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in
their nightclothes, flooded into the common room.
There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw
Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled
in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any
moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-
year darted up to her and prodded her backside with
his big toe.

“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.

“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the
Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. “They’re
pleased!”

“Yeah ... great ...”

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he
chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind. ... He was
moving along the tunnel into the first cave. ... He had
chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . .
but that would not take him long. . . .

There was a rap on the common room door and every
Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the
soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door
knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?”

“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice
that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother,
Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got
him? Open the door!”

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst
themselves, terrified. Then, without warning, there
came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was
firing a gun into the door.

Page | 666 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“ALECTO\ If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter —
d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys?
ANSWER ME!” Amyous bellowed, shaking the door for
all he was worth, but still it did not open. The
Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the
most frightened began scampering back up the
staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was
wondering whether he ought not to blast open the
door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could
do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang
out beyond the door.

“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”

“Trying — to get — through this damned — door!”
shouted Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to
open it, now!”

“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor
McGonagall. “Didn’t Professor Flitwick let her in
earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps
she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t
wake up half the castle.”

“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it!
Garn! Do it, now!

“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall,
with awful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the
knocker and the musical voice asked again,

“Where do Vanished objects go?”

“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” replied
Professor McGonagall.

“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and
the door swung open.



Page | 667 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind
sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the
threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his
sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes,
which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on
the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.

“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed.
“I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it
— and what’s the Dark Lord going to say?” he
shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking
himself on the forehead with his fist. “We haven’t got
him, and they’ve gorn and killed her!”

“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall
impatiently, who had stooped down to examine
Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.”

“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not
after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and
sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve
got Potter!”

“ ‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply.
“What do you mean, ‘got Potter’?”

“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw
Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!”

“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw
Tower? Potter belongs in my House!”

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little
strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva
McGonagall gushed up inside him.

“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I
dunno why, do I?”



Page | 668 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes
swept the room. Twice they passed right over the
place where Harry and Luna stood.

“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his
piglike face suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll
do. Well say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them
kids up there” — he looked up at the starry ceiling
toward the dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced
her to press her Mark, and that’s why he got a false
alarm. ... He can punish them. Couple of kids more or
less, what’s the difference?”

“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage
and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had
turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and
your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me
make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass
off your many ineptitudes on the students of
Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.”

“Excuse me?”

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close
to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of
hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at
him as if he were something disgusting she had found
stuck to a lavatory seat.

“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva
McGonagall. Your time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge
here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the
price.”

And he spat in her face.

Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand,
and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.”



Page | 669 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio\”



The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed
through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and
howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a
shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a
bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.

“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood
thundering through his brain, “you need to really
mean it.”

“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching
her heart. “Potter — you’re here! What — ? How — ?”
She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that
was foolish!”

“He spat at you,” said Harry.

“Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but
don’t you realize — ?”

“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic
steadied him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on
the way.”

“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked
Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility
Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to
overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered
backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at
the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.

“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call
him,” Harry told Luna. “He already knows where I
am.”



In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected
to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort

Page | 670 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green
boat. ... He had nearly reached the island where the
stone basin stood. ...

“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!”

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do.
Professor, do you know where the diadem of
Ravenclaw is?”

“The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t
it been lost for centuries?” She sat up a little
straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter madness,
for you to enter this castle — ”

“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something
hidden here that I’m supposed to find, and it could be
the diadem — if I could just speak to Professor
Flitwick — ”

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass:
Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna
could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet,
pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and
said, “Imperio.”

Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up
her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor
McGonagall and handed it over along with his own.
Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor
McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of
shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and
snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly
together.

“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face
him again with superb indifference to the Carrows’



Page | 671 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




predicament, “if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does
indeed know that you are here — ”

As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain
blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for
a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion
had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay
safe beneath the surface —

“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry
came back: He was clutching Luna’s shoulder to
steady himself.

“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer.
Professor, I’m acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must
find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got to get
the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s
me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a
few more or less, not now — ” not now he knows I’m
attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in
his head.

“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated
with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself
up to her fullest height.

“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named while you search for this — this
object.”

“Is that possible?”

“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we
teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am
sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all
put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will
have to be done about Professor Snape — ”

“Let me — ”

Page | 672 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“ — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege,
with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be
advisable to take as many innocent people out of the
way as possible. With the Floo Network under
observation, and Apparition impossible within the
grounds — ”

“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained
about the passageway leading into the Hog’s Head.

“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students — ”

“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death
Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries
they won’t be interested in anyone who’s
Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.”

“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed
her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon
their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and
hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath
the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea
creatures. “Come. We must alert the other Heads of
House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.”

She marched toward the door, and as she did so she
raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats
with spectacle markings around their eyes. The
Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral
staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall,
Harry, and Luna hurried back down.

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the
Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan
dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and
Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.

They had descended two more floors when another
set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar

Page | 673 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the
pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but
before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to
become aware of their company. She halted, raised
her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”

“It is I,” said a low voice.

From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.

Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had
forgotten the details of Snape ’s appearance in the
magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy
black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how
his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not
wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual
black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready
for a fight.

“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.

“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,”
said Professor McGonagall.

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over
Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he
knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up
too, ready to attack.

“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto
had apprehended an intruder.”

“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave
you that impression?”

Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm,
where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.



Page | 674 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You
Death Eaters have your own private means of
communication, I forgot.”

Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were
still probing the air all about her, and he was moving
gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what
he was doing.

“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the
corridors, Minerva.”

“You have some objection?”

“I wonder what could have brought you out of your
bed at this late hour?”

“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor
McGonagall.

“Really? But all seems calm.”

Snape looked into her eyes.

“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you
have, I must insist — ”

Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could
have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and
for a split second Harry thought that Snape must
crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield
Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off
balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the
wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to
curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way
of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire
that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape



Page | 675 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent
that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed
and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of
pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by
forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with
echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another,
into its breast —

“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind
him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw
Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the
corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the
enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the
rear.

“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do
no more murder at Hogwarts!”

Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which
Snape had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life.
Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it
flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had
to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall
and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape
was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all
thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom
door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry,
“Coward! COWARD !”

“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along
the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind
them, into the deserted classroom where Professors
McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a
smashed window.

“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and
Luna ran into the room.

Page | 676 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window,
ignoring Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his
sudden appearance.

“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike
Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand ... and he
seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.”

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a
huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness
toward the perimeter wall.

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great
deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up.

“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest
beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. “My dear
boy ... what a surprise ... Minerva, do please explain.
... Severus ... what ... ?”

“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said
Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped
hole in the window.

“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead.
He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him,
and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the
underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with
murder in his heart —

“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s
coming now!”

“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,”
she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick
gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter has
work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We
need to put in place every protection of which we are
capable while Potter does what he needs to do.”

Page | 677 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able
to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” squeaked
Flitwick.

“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout.

“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall,
and between the two witches there passed a look of
grim understanding. “I suggest we establish basic
protection around the place, then gather our students
and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated,
though if any of those who are over age wish to stay
and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.”

“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying
toward the door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in
twenty minutes with my House.”

And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her
muttering, “Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff
pods ... yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting
those.”

“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he
could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand
through the smashed window and started muttering
incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird
rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the
power of the wind into the grounds.

“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms
master, “Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is
important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of
Ravenclaw is?”

“ — Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw?”
squeaked Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes
amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much
use in this situation!”

Page | 678 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you
ever seen it?”

“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long
since lost, boy!”

Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and
panic. What, then, was the Horcrux?

“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great
Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to
Harry and Luna to follow her.

They had just reached the door when Slughorn
rumbled into speech.

“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus
mustache aquiver. “What a to-do! I’m not at all sure
whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a
way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay
him will be in most grievous peril — ”

“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great
Hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor
McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your students,
we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to
sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us
within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.”

“Minerva!” he said, aghast.

“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide
upon its loyalties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall.
“Go and wake your students, Horace.”

Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and
Luna ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken
up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised
her wand.

Page | 679 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now — ”



The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view,
shouting, “Students out of bed! Students in the
corridors!”

“They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted
McGonagall. “Now go and do something constructive!
Find Peeves!”

“P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never
heard the name before.

“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peevesl Haven’t you been
complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go
and fetch him, at once!”

Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had
taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-
shouldered, muttering under his breath.

“And now — Piertotum Locomotori” cried Professor
McGonagall.

And all along the corridor the statues and suits of
armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the
echoing crashes from the floors above and below,
Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle
had done the same.

“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor
McGonagall. “Man the boundaries, protect us, do
your duty to our school!”

Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues
stampeded past Harry: some of them smaller, others
larger, than life. There were animals too, and the
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and
spiked balls on chains.

Page | 680 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss
Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring
them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other
Gryffindors.”

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry
and Luna running back toward the concealed
entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran,
they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling
cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to
the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.

“That was Potter!”

“ Harry Potted”

“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”

But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached
the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry
leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to
admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the
steep staircase.

“Wh — ?”

As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few
stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than
when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin
were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie
Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and
Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.

“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him
at the foot of the stairs.

“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the
school — Snape’s run for it — What are you doing
here? How did you know?”

Page | 681 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,”
Fred explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss
the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the
Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.”

“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”

“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s
meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry
said. “We’re fighting.”

There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of
the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as
they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order
of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old
Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading
up into the main castle.

“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding
out his free hand; she took it and followed him back
up the stairs.

The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people
remained below in the Room of Requirement, and
Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with
Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill,
and Fleur.

“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her
daughter as Harry approached. “I won’t permit it! The
boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go home!”

“I won’t!”

Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her
mother’s grip.

“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army — ”



Page | 682 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




“A teenagers’ gang!”



“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which
no one else has dared to do!” said Fred.

“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old
enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her
with you — ”

Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of
themselves.

“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do
this. Everyone underage will have to leave, it’s only
right.”

“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears
sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t
stand waiting there alone and not knowing and — ”

Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at
him beseechingly, but he shook his head and she
turned away bitterly.

“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel
back to the Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then,
and—”

There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone
else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced
slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the
nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-
rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it
started? I only just found out, so I — I — ”

Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not
expected to run into most of his family. There was a
long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur
turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent

Page | 683 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling




attempt to break the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle
Teddy?”

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between
the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like ice.

“I — oh yes — he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes,
Tonks is with him — at her mother’s — ”

Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one
another, frozen.

“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a
photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to
Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of
bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera.

“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin
nearly dropped his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was
a pompous prat, I was a — a — ”

“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry
moron,” said Fred.

Percy swallowed.

“Yes, I was!”

“Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred,
holding out his hand to Percy.

Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward,
pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling
hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his
father.

“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said.
